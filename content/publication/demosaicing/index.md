abstract: Image acquisition in low-light environments is fundamentally challenging due to the photon-limited nature of the scene, which results in severe noise and incomplete color information. Imaging sensors operating under such conditions require robust post-processing to recover visually coherent, full-color images. In these conditions, the photon arrival process can be modeled as a Poisson distribution, which introduces noise that complicates image reconstruction. Furthermore, the use of a color filter array leads to missing color information at each pixel, which exacerbates the challenge. As a result, denoising and demosaicing become ill-posed and interdependent tasks. We propose a self-supervised method that jointly addresses denoising and demosaicing under low-light conditions without requiring clean reference images. Our approach achieves a PSNR higher by 2.0 dB compared to best state-of-the-art methods at gain of 20 and is close to the supervised method.
