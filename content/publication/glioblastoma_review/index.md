abstract: "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a poor prognosis. Traditional diagnosis relies on invasive biopsies, which pose surgical risks. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have improved non-invasive GBM diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offering potential advantages in accuracy and efficiency. Objective: This review aims to identify the methodologies and technologies employed in AI-based GBM diagnostics. It further evaluates the performance of AI models using standard metrics, highlighting both their strengths and limitations. Methodology: In accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across major academic databases. A total of 104 articles were identified in the initial search, and 15 studies were selected for final analysis after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Outcomes: The  included studies indicated  that the signal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) is the most frequently used MRI modality in AI-based GBM diagnostics. Multimodal approaches integrating T1WI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have demonstrated improved classification performance. Additionally, AI models have shown potential in surpassing conventional diagnostic methods, enabling automated tumor classification and enhancing prognostic predictions."
