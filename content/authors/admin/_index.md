I am a researcher and Ph.D. student in Physics at Universidad Industrial de Santander, with research interests spanning Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Computational Optics, and Responsible Artificial Intelligence. 

My work focuses on integrating physical modeling and numerical optimization with deep learning methods to develop safe, accurate, and efficient perception systems, with applications in medical imaging, optics, and spectral analysis. I have participated in interdisciplinary projects and published in international conferences and journals, directing my research toward the development of robust, interpretable, and ethically responsible solutions.
